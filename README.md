# LLM-for-GoAigo
GoAlgo LLM Module
This module integrates a lightweight open-source Large Language Model (LLM) into the GoAlgo platform to enhance interactivity and learning.
It enables the system to understand natural language commands and provide clear educational explanations for algorithms, allowing users to either request algorithm visualizations or ask for theoretical clarifications.

Built using FastAPI and Phi-3 (Microsoft), the LLM runs locally with no external API dependencies, ensuring fast, secure, and offline-ready responses.

Key Features:
• Understands and executes user text commands 
• Explains algorithmic logic step-by-step in natural language
• Easily integrates with the existing GoAlgo web interface
• Lightweight and optimized for local deployment (CPU-friendly)

This addition transforms GoAlgo into an AI-assisted educational environment, merging interactivity with intelligent explanation to make algorithm learning more intuitive and engaging.
